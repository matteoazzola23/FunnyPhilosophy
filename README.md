My first project in HTML, CSS, JavaScript!

It's a (philosophical) quiz that I created for testing my knowledge when creating simple webpages. I worked on DOM, array manipulation, and creating functions to make the game work: creating a div that pops up when a card is clicked, populate questions in the div, replying to them, adding points in the progress bar, closing the div and restart the game. 

Unfortunately, the quiz isn't built in a mobile responsive way. I'll try to work on it in the future if needed. 

Project realized for the conclusion of the first module of the Web Developement course by IronHack - Amsterdam.
